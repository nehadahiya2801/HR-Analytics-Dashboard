<br>
<b> Problem statement </b> - Human Resources at PwC's Tealecom client is highly into diversity and inclusion as they need a workforce of diverse talents and backgrounds to succed in an increasingly complex and heterogenous world. They have been working hard to improve gender imbalance at executive mangement level, but they're not seeing any progress.
<br>
<br>
<b>What I'll do - </b>
<ul>
  <li>Create visualisations using Power BI to represent HR data, particularly focusing on gender related KPI's</li>
  <li>Identifying potential root causes for the slow progress in achieving gender balance at each job level </li>
</ul>
<b>Finding based on Analysis</b>-
<ul>
  <li>In terms of hiring, % of women hired is decent enough, only in sales and marketing department , %of female recruited are less that too for positions of junior officer and manager level. Thus this can be worked upon.</li>
 
<li>In terms of FY 21 Promotions, in sales & Marketing department, despite of equal FY20 Avg performance rating of men and women, females are not getting promoted & this disparity can be seen at all job levels. Also for operations department females constitute 40% of promotions, due to promotional issues at manager level.</li>
 
<li>Analysing Leavers data indicates that #leavers and promotion rate are inversaly proportional. Also female in age group of 40-49 are resigning more.</li>
</ul>
